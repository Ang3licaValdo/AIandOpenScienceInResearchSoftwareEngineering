Second task
===========

For this task we have to represent in some way how many figures there
are in each paper, for that i used a bar graph which data comes from
finding all of the ‘figure’ tags with the method ‘find_all’ from
BeautifulSoup and then counting the number of tags per paper and
appending that number to a list. You’ll get the bar graph as soons as
you execute the Python file called ‘visualization.py’as a png.

For executing the ‘visualization.py’ file, inside the ‘2ndAssigment’ directory,
run:

.. code:: bash

     python visualization.py

As an output you’ll get a png file called 'graph_figures.png'.
